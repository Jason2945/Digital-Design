PLD = Programmable Logic Device

CAD = Computer Aided Design

HDL = Hardware Design Language


VHDL = VHSIC Hardware Design Language
VHSIC = Very High Speed Integrated Circuit

Inputs, Outputs, Logic process defined using statements based on C Programming language.

## PLD Design Flow

1. Define the problem
2. Develop the equations to solve the required logic operation
3. Enter the design into the PC by drawing a schematic or by using a VHDL text editor
4. Simulate the input/output condition via timing waveform analysis
5. Program the internal circuitry of the PLD to implement the logic operation
6. Test the final programmed PLD via actual input and output signal

## 4 Types of PLD
SPLD = Simple Programmable Logic Device

CPLD = Complex Programmable Logic Device

ASIC = Application Specific Circuits

FPGA = Field-Programmable Gate Arrays

## Working in Quartus Prime 

BDF = Block Diagram File
- Used to create the logic gates

VWF = Vector Waveform File
- Used to draw waveforms for the inputs and simulate the outputs

VHD = VHDL Files
- Can be used to design the logics through boolean equations.

- Library Declaration is the section declaring the libraries to be included in the program. These libraries are used by the complier to reslove reference to the various program commands
- Entity Declaration is the section defining the input and output ports.
- Architecture Body is the section defining the logic functions to be implemented.
