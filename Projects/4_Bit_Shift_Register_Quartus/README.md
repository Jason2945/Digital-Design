## Objective ##

- Project objective is to gain a deeper understanding of shift register counters.
- Project will analyze and test serval shift registers using Quartus Prime Software.
- The circuits will be implemented onto the DE10 Standard Board.
- 4 bit shift register will be made with the D Flip-Flop.
- vwf will be made to display the output of a shift register with D Flip-Flop.
- 4 bit shift register will be made with the JK Flop-Flop.
- vwf will be made to display the output of a shift register with JK Flip-Flop
- JK shift register will be compared to D shift register and see the difference.
- Both shift register will be implemented on the DE10 Standard Board with the inputs as push buttons and the output
is on LEDS.
