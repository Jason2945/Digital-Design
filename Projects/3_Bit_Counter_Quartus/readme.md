## Objective ##

- Project objective is to gain a deeper understanding of synchronous counters.
- Project will analyze and test a 3 bit synchronous counter using the JK-flip flop.
- The 3 bit counter will be connected to a 7447 BCD to SSD driver.
- The output will be displayed on the DE10 Standard board.
- switch button will be implemented for reset and push button will be implemented as a stand in clock.
