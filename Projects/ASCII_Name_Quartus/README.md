## Objective ##

- Purpose of this project is to manually reduce a complex logic equation and implement it into Quartus Prime.
- Name Detector project will have 7 inputs and 2 outputs.
- The design work will include truth tables and k-maps.
- The equations for the sum of products (SOP) for the first name and last name will be written in VHD files.
- Modelsim will be used to test the HDL code and make sure the code is working correctly through waveform verification.
- The design will be implemented onto the DE10 Standard Board. 
- The seven bits will be switches and the led will be the output display.
