## Objective ##

- The project will be a full adder circuit in VHDL.
- Project purpose is to gain experience designing and testing arithmetic circuits.
- Project will be implementing SSI (small scale integration) and MSI (medium scale integration) logic gates
- Project will be written in VHDL on Quartus Prime.
- vwf will be made to check the waveform of the output.
