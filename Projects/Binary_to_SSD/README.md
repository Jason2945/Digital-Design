# Objective #

- Create a binary to seven segment display.
- The seven segment display will display conversion of binary to decimal or binary to hexadecimal.
- This will introduce the concepts of constants and coding to seven-segment display through VHDL code.
- Calculations will be made use IEEE.NUMERIC_STD.ALL.
- Connections will be made through concurrent processes.
- Self checking testbench will be written and tested in ModelSim to make sure calculation and coding is correct.
- Program will be compiled and tested on the DE10-Standard Board.
