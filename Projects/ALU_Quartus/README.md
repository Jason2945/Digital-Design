# Objective #

- Create an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) through VHDL code.
- This ALU design will have 11 inputs and 8 outputs.
- This ALU design will be capable of 5 operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication, AND operation, and OR operation.
- This ALU design will use signed numbers. Thus, positive number and negative numbers will be used.
- The limit of the DE10 Standard board only has 10 switches, thus operation will be 4 bit number by 4 bit number.
- Self-testing testbench will be written and tested on ModelSim before programmed onto DE-10 Standard board.
- Program will be tested on DE-10 Standard board to make sure it works.
