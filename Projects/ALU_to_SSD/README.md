# Objective #

- Create an ALU that displays on the seven segment display
- Use of hierarchical design to implement the system
- Previous project of ALU Calculator onto LED display will be used.
- Previous project of Binary to SSD will be used.
- The two projects will be used as components for this project and used as functional modules.
- This allows the testing of each modules individually to make sure they work before being implemented in a hierarchical design.
- The code will have a self-testing testbench to make sure results are accurate.
- The testbench waveform will be displayed on the ModelSim application to make sure design is correct before being implemented onto the DE-10 Standard board.
- The design will be implemented on the DE-10 Standard board to display working in real life.
