## Objective ##

The objective of this project is to create a simple boolean equation. This boolean equation is to gain experience on writing to VHD files using Quartus Prime.
Once the vhd file is written, it will be tested on the vwf (Vector Wave File) of Quartus Prime to check the output of X.

<br>
The boolean equation used is below.

- X = (a * b) + (c * d)
